# LightboxGallery
LightboxGallery is a HTML-based web application which displays images in a grid, whereby each image can be interacted with and displayed via a custom lightbox. Within the lightbox, the different images can be traversed using arrows or an image carousel.

This web application was originally written in the winter of 2018.

# Usage
